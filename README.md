# Boids
A Python project to simulate and visualise the coordinated animal motions such as bird flocks or fish schools. ([Wikipedia Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids))  
The pseudocode, on which this project is based, can be found [here](https://vergenet.net/~conrad/boids/pseudocode.html).  
I'm using a basic pygame gameloop for visualisation.
